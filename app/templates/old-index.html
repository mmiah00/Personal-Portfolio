        <p> 
            Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Maisha (Ma-ee-sha) and <br>
            I’m a current student at Boston University. I plan on majoring <br>
            in Computer Science & Statistics and minoring in Economics. I was <br>
            born and raised in New York City but love going to school in <br>
            Boston! I'm a big fan of exploring and I’m always looking to <br>
            learn new things.
